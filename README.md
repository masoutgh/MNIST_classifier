PyTorch Implementation of a Basic Neural Network for MNIST Classification

This repository contains a basic neural network implemented in Python using the popular deep learning framework PyTorch. The network is designed to classify images from the MNIST dataset, which is a collection of handwritten digits.

The neural network consists of an input layer, 3 diffrent 2d Convolution and 3 linear layer. The hidden layers use the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. The network is trained using the cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.

The trained model achieves a test accuracy of about 98.5% on the MNIST dataset. We have provided the code and a Jupyter Notebook in the ipynb format, which walks through the steps of training and evaluating the model.
